      <p class="block text-4xl font-medium py-4">My name is Gaylon Alfano.</p>

        I am a husband and father to the three beautiful boys. Originally from Austin, Texas,
        I have lived and worked in several countries throughout my life, but China has always
        been a second home to me for many years. Our family has been living in Shanghai, China
        for the past seven years.

        I've always had an interest in programming over the years
        but only dabbled in it at the surface level. That all changed a couple years ago. Since then I have
        focused on expanding my surface-level skills to transition into the world of web development and data science.

        This site is primarily for testing out and documenting my
        learning journey as I "摸着石头过河" (feel my way) into new territories and technologies.
        My own experience learning Mandarin has confirmed that anything can be achieved if you're willing to put in the effort.
        That, and the neccesity to toss aside your pride in order for true learning to happen.

        This journey into programming and software development has certainly tested
        my resolve on several occasions, but I love to document my struggles since I consider myself a newbie in many
        ways. You'll see my ask questions that may seem obvious to a more experienced developer. Nonetheless, I hope to
        document my journey and connect more dots as I start to put all these pieces together. Feel free to “蹭车” and come along
        for the ride!
